# TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION-
The Titanic Survival Prediction model is designed to estimate the likelihood of survival for passengers and crew aboard the RMS Titanic based on various factors. These factors typically include:

Passenger Class: First, second, or third class.
Gender: Male or female.
Age: The age of the individual.
Ticket Fare: The amount paid for the ticket.
Embarked: The port of embarkation (Cherbourg, Queenstown, or Southampton).
The model uses historical data from the Titanic's passenger list, which includes information on who survived and who did not, to train the prediction algorithm. It often employs statistical or machine learning techniques to identify patterns and relationships between these factors and survival outcomes.

By inputting these variables, the model estimates the probability of survival for a given individual, helping to understand which factors had the most significant impact on survival chances during the disaster. This analysis can offer insights into historical biases and social dynamics of the era, as well as contribute to broader discussions on survival strategies and safety protocols.
